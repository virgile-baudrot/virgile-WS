# Salut

In the network of my research interests, the hub is the following question:

## How contaminants travel into food webs?

More specifically, I am a young researcher in *EcoHealth* sciences, and for now I am a postdoc at the CNRS Lab LBBE in the University of Lyon 1.

I did a PhD on *modeling trophic interaction including transfert of biological and chemical contaminants*, with several applications with the parasite *Echinococcus multilocularis*  for the eco-epidemiological part and on *heavy metals* for the ecotoxicological part.

The question underlying my research is *how contaminants, such as chemical compounds and parasites, are transfered within a food webs and how structures and compositions of food webs respond to them?*

And to answer those questions, I develop *dynamical systems* and *Bayesian models*.

$$ \mathcal{S}kills=\int_\Omega f(EcoHealth, \, ODE, \, Bayes) d \omega $$
