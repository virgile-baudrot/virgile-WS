# Biography

I am a researcher in EcoHealth (actually a postdoc student at the CNRS Lab LBBE and University of Lyon 1).
I am particularly interested in how contaminants, such as chemical compounds and parasites, are transfered within a food web and how the structure and composition of the fodd web respond to it.
